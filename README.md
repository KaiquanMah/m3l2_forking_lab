Meta Frontend Development Course 3 Git and Github

Exercise - Create a Repository with Forking

* Commits and pull request updates from aBranch to main branch were slow
* https://stackabuse.com/git-merge-branch-into-master/
* at the end, we also used
* git checkout main
* git merge aBranch
* to merge changes pushed to aBranch to main -> not sure why no more pull requests after the 1st commit
